# HTML-CSS Projects
## Introduction
These projects are designed to demonstrate the web graphics and animation work that can be done with HTML and CSS *alone* (i.e., without any JS). Projects are generally listed from the most basic/easiest to the most challenging.

## Projects
### Creating a rectangle
Files: `rectangle.html`, `rectangle.css`

Create a `div` of class `rectangle`. As soon as you give the `div` a width (`width`), height (`height`), and background color (`background-color`), you&rsquo;ve got yourself a rectangle.

### Creating a circle
Files: `circle.html`, `circle.css`

In CSS, a circle is simply a square (a special case of rectangle) with `border-radius` set to 50%.

### Creating a parallelogram
Files: `parallelogram.html`, `parallelogram.css`

Of course, a rectangle *is* a parallelogram. But to create a parallelogram of *arbitrary* internal angle, start with a rectangle and skew it with the `transform: skewX()` property.

### Creating a trapezoid
Files: `trapezoid.html`, `trapezoid.css`

There&rsquo;s an interesting alternative way of creating a trapezoid, where you&rsquo;re not so much creating a trapezoid as you are creating the *illusion* of a trapezoid. Here&rsquo;s the basic idea: place a rectangle inside a &ldquo;3D perspective&rdquo;, and rotate the rectangle along the <var>x</var>-axis, and you have what *looks like*, from the viewer&rsquo;s perspective, a trapezoid.

### Creating a hexagon
Files: `hexagon.html`, `hexagon.css`

One way to construct a trapezoid is from two trapezoids&mdash;one right-side-up and one up-side-down.

### Swaying Faces
Files: `swaying_faces`, `swaying_faces.css`

Five faces that sway side to side indefinitely.
