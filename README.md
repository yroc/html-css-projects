# HTML-CSS Projects
## Introduction
These projects are designed to demonstrate what can be done with HTML and CSS *alone* (i.e., without any JS). Projects are generally listed from the most basic/easiest to the most challenging.
## Projects

Creating a rectangle. Create a `div` class `rectangle`. As soon as you give it a width (`width`), height (`height`), and background color (`background-color`), you&rsquo;ve got yourself a rectangle.
